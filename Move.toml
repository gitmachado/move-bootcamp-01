[dependencies]
# Sui framework dependency is intentionally omitted here to allow the toolchain
# to auto-include the correct framework dependencies. Including an explicit
# git dependency can cause version/address mismatches that lead to verifier
# errors during testing. If you need to pin a specific framework version,
# re-add it carefully.

[addresses]
move_bootcamp_01 = "0x0"

# Named addresses will be accessible in Move as `@name`. They're also exported:
# for example, `std = "0x1"` is exported by the Standard Library.

[dev-dependencies]
# The dev-dependencies section allows overriding dependencies for `--test` and
# `--dev` modes. You can introduce test-only dependencies here.
